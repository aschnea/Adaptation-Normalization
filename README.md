# Adaptation-Normalization
This repository contains my PhD project investigating how adaptation (recent sensory experience) affects Divisive Normalization (a network computation in neuronal circuits).

In this repository you will find a guide that lists the raw data files, the figures, and the names/descriptions of the scripts that produce the figures which are all included.
